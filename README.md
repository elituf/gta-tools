## Installing
**Option 1** - Download  
Download the latest release [here](https://codeberg.org/futile/gta-tools/releases/download/latest/gta-tools.exe) and place it somewhere convenient for you, such as Documents. You could then make a shortcut titled "GTA Tools", and pin it to taskbar or Start.

**Option 2** - Build from source  
You will need the Rust toolchain, which can be obtained [here](https://rustup.rs). Follow the instructions of its installer. Once you have Rust installed, clone this repo and navigate to it. You can then run `cargo build --release`. Once you do that, you can use the binary located at `.\target\release\gta-tools.exe` in the same way as **Option 1**.
